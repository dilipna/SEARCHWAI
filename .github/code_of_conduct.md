# Project Contribution & Collaboration Guidelines

## Welcome
Thank you for checking out this project!  
This repository is part of my ongoing work in **AI, machine learning, and data-driven applications**.  
Contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome — whether you’re fixing bugs, improving documentation, or exploring new directions.

## Contribution Rules
To keep this project professional, respectful, and helpful to others:

- Be kind and constructive in discussions and pull requests.  
- Keep commits clean and meaningful — describe what and why, not just what changed.  
- Respect others’ perspectives; learning together is the goal.  
- Ensure code is well-documented and tested before submitting.  
- Avoid spammy, off-topic, or harmful content of any kind.

## Reporting Issues
If you find a bug or have a suggestion:
1. Open an **issue** describing it clearly.  
2. Suggest a fix or idea if you have one.  
3. Be patient — responses are reviewed as time allows.

## Acknowledgment
This project thrives on collaboration and shared curiosity.  
By contributing, you help make open AI research and learning more accessible to everyone.
